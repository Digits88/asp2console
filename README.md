Asp2console
===========

## Version 1.0

A Classic ASP approach to send messages from server to the Browser Console. That's useful for debbuging applications that use AJAX requests to ASP scripts.

Credits for the project [Chrome Logger](https://craig.is/writing/chrome-logger), whom created the protocol to allow the communication between the client and server.

It was tested succesfully on Google Chrome 51 and Firefox 47. Firefox offers native support for the protocol since version 46, while Chrome needs you to install this [plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromephp/noaneddfkdjfnfdakjjmocngnfkfehhd).

Here is an example:

	<!--#include file="asp2console.asp" -->
	<%
	console.log("Hello console on ASP")
	%>

Unfortunately it doesn't work on Firebug console, only on browser's native console.

Thanks for cuixiping and Tu√∞rul Topuz, both creators of the two project dependencies.
